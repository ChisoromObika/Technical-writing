## Hello hello, I write technical and non-technical easy-to-understand cybersecurity content.

## About me
As a HubSpot-certified content and inbound marketer, I have been trained with the techniques used to nurture customers/readers through all stages of their customer journey using customer-centric content.

As someone in the cybersecurity field, I have first-hand experience with how security technologies work and threats out there that could affect both individuals and companies.

Mix both of these and you have a writer who can deliver accurate interesting content.

## I write articles on 
1. Digital security for individuals.
2. Digital security for companies.
3. Privacy-related topics.
4. Open Source Intelligence topics.
5. Dark web-related topics
6. General security and AI matters.
